# Projects-2018

A couple of reports from my data-oriented computing class taken in the Spring 2018 semester. 

The Baby Name Trends report is an analysis on the occurence of baby names from 1880 to 2016. In this report I had to firgure out basic parsing an data collection techniques to optimize the data importation and manipulation. From here I did basic data analysis to find any cool properties of the data set (what I found can be seen easily in the paper).

The Chloropleths report was a look at climate data using chloropleths to visualize trends. Since I was working with SVG files, I had to import my climate data, which was in CSV, into python and then move that data to the entries in the SVG files following XML structure. After I was able to figure out that process I plotted various years of pollution data to see trends and compare it to other studies to see if my analysis falls in line with the majority. The main point of this report was to become familiar with the XML programming language.
